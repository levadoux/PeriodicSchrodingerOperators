% main2D.m - eigenvalues of periodic SchrÃ¶dinger operator in 1D
% The period of the potential V is equal to 2pi along both axes. 
% The used parameters to solve problems on [0,2pi]*[0,2pi]
% with generalized periodic BCs are :
% 1) a random draw of n_rand values in the Brillouin zone [0,1]*[0,1]
% --> the founded eigenvalues are plotted in BLUE
% 2) a discretization (n_lines values for each edge)
% of the boundaries of the square [0,0.5]*[0,0.5]
% (a quarter of the Brillouin zone) 
% --> the founded eigenvalues are plotted in BLACK
